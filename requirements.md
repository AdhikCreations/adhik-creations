## Design Strategy

### Design Principles
- **Clean and Simple**: Prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
- **Responsive**: Ensure the site works well on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Visual Appeal**: Use high-quality images and consistent color themes.
- **User-Centric**: Design with the target audience in mind, making it intuitive.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **HTML5**: For structuring content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap**: For faster layout creation and mobile-first design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements (e.g., testimonials carousel).
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.
- **Optional**: Netlify or Vercel for enhanced deployment options (free tiers).

### Design Instructions

#### 1. Layout Planning
- **Header**:
  - Place the business logo on the left.
  - Add a navigation menu on the right with links to all main sections.
- **Hero Section (Home Page)**:
  - Use a full-width banner image with overlay text (e.g., "Bringing Dreams to Life").
- **Content Sections**:
  - Use grid layouts for services and portfolio pages (e.g., 3 columns per row for services, with cards for each service).
  - Testimonials displayed in a horizontal carousel (or vertical stack for mobile).
- **Footer**:
  - Divide into 3 columns: Copyright, Quick Links, Social Media.

#### 2. Color Scheme and Fonts
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: Warm tones (e.g., gold, maroon, or orange) to resonate with Indian cultural aesthetics.
  - Secondary: Neutral tones (e.g., white, beige, or light gray).
  - Accent: Contrasting color (e.g., teal or green) for buttons and links.
- **Fonts**:
  - Headings: Elegant serif fonts (e.g., Playfair Display).
  - Body: Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Open Sans).

#### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
- Use **media queries** to adjust font sizes, padding, and layouts for smaller screens.
- Test on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistency.

#### 4. Images
- Compress images using tools like TinyPNG to optimize load times.
- Use consistent aspect ratios for galleries and service images (e.g., 4:3 or 16:9).

#### 5. Interactivity
- Implement a carousel for testimonials using Bootstrap.
- Use smooth scroll for navigation links.
- Add hover effects for buttons and images.
